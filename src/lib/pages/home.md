## `Hello World!`

**Welcome to the official website for the RHHS Computer Science Club!**

The RHHS computer science club is an inclusive student-run club, aimed at exposing its members to the world of programming. Club meetings occur weekly on **Thursdays** after school, in the **library** from **3:40 to 4:40**. Our members are able to choose which group they believe aligns the most with their goals: junior contest, senior contest, or web. More information on these groups can be found under the ["Groups" section above](/groups).

For any further questions or inquiries, please contact us by email ([rhhs.compsci@gmail.com](mailto:rhhs.compsci@gmail.com)) or through instagram ([@rhhs.cs.club](https://www.instagram.com/rhhs.cs.club/)).
