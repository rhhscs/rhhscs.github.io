## Events

**In addition to lessons and workshops, CS Club  and the CS department run many events every year**. Here is a brief overview of the ones we hope to run this year:

### Contests

#### Cheerio

Cheerio is CS Club's own coding contest which we typically run multiple times a year. The topics covered vary but typically include problems about
**competitive programming**, **code golf**, **CTF**, and more. Come for snacks, swag, a sizeable prize pool, and fun!

#### Canadian Computing Contest

The **[Canadian Computing Contest](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc-cco.html)**, run by the University of Waterloo, is the premiere such contest in Canada. It is usually written in February and has two sections, Junior and Senior, each with 5 problems in increasing difficulty.

#### Beaver Computing Contest

The [**Beaver Computing Contest**](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/bcc.html), run by the University of Waterloo, is a contest aimed towards beginner programmers. It consists of problems requiring the use of computational and logical thinking, but **no coding**. It is usually written in November and contains 15 multiple choice questions to be answered in 45 minutes.

### Hackathons

**A hackathon is an event where teams of programmers with a limited amount of time (usually 24 or 48 hours) create and pitch a product.**

#### YRHacks

**[YRHacks](https://yrhacks.ca/)** is a school board-wide in-person/virtual hackathon where teams of students work together to create and pitch a product from scratch.
YRHacks also runs many workshops and fun activities during the event, so you'll learn something even if you don't end up submitting your product.

#### NRGHacks

Last year, we ran **NRGHacks**, a hackathon between **N**ewmarket High School, **R**ichmond Hill High School, and **G**.W. Williams High School (hence the name). We are hoping to run it again this year so make sure to follow our socials for any updates!
